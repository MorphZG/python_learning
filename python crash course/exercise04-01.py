# store 3 different pizza names in a list
# use a for loop to print each namedtuple

pizzas = ['margarita', 'mjesana', 'slavonska']

for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)
    print(f"i really like {pizza.upper()} with good cheese\n")

print('I eat pizza once a month')

# add simple statement to each iteration print
# add a line at the end of programm, outside for loop that states you like pizza.
