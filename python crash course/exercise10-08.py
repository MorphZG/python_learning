''' Cats and dogs
Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three names of cats in
the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. Write a program
that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the
screen. Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error,
and print a friendly message if a file is missing. Move one of the files to a
different location on your system, and make sure the code in the except block
executes properly.

    I will try to open and read two files, will catch the FileNotFoundError
    in case there is no such file on specified location
