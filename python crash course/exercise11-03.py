'''Employee
Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first
name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes.
Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual salary by
default but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods,
test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp()
method so you dont have to create a new employee instance in each test method.
Run your test cse and make sure both test pass.
