'''Lottery Analysis
You can use a loop to see how hard it might be to win the kind of lottery
you just modeled. Make a list or tuple called my_ticket. Write a loop that
keeps pulling numbers until your ticket wins. Print a message reporting
how many times the loop had to run to give you a winning ticket.

from random import choice

# simple list of numbers and letters. draw winner from here
choose_from = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

# this is my lucky ticket
my_ticket = [7, 9, 'c', 3]

# draw tickets until my_ticket wins
# count number of turns
turn = 0
winner = []

while my_ticket != winner:
    winner = []  # empty the winning ticket at start of each turn
    while len(winner) < 4:  # build winning ticket
        draw = choice(choose_from)
        if draw not in winner:
            winner.append(draw)
    turn += 1  # count end of turn
print(f'winning ticket is: {winner}')
print(f'number of turns: {turn}')

'''
    moj kod nije ispravan jer osim sto usporedujem brojeve i slova
    unutar my_ticket i winner, moj kod usporeduje i redosljed.
    ako je moja kombinacija [7, 9, c, 3], a dobitna kombinacija [9, 7, c, 3]
    moj kod ce nastaviti sa loopom dok ne pogodi tocan redosljed.
