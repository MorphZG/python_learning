When i started with my python learning i had a lot of AHA! moments when i finaly
understood something or when i found a creative or simple solution to something.

When i am looking at these files now, most of them are nothing special since
those AHA! moments doesnt come so often as before. I could probably delete
most of these files since there is actually nothing interesting about them
but i will keep them just as a reminder how far you can go if you persist and
love what you do.

Even the longest journey starts with one small step.

Keep on learning and never give up of your dreams.
