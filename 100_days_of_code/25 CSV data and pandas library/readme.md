### Working with CSV files and Pandas library

###### intro
Will be working with data files and analyzing the data with Pandas library.  
Starting with basic introduction to csv module than comparing it with pandas.  
Pandas is one of most popular libraries for data analysis so it is often first  
choice when working with data :) obviously.  

Before main assignment, instructor talks more about pandas documentation and shows  
her approach when learning the new library. I find it very useful since reading  
the official documentation is not really something you will enjoy right away. I also learned is how writing good documentation is key to good understanding of  
new software.
