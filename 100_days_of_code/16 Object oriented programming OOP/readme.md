**day_16**
## OOP and virtual coffee machine
Building a virtual coffee machine with **OOP** principles.  
I have downloaded these files:  
* coffee_maker.py
* menu.py
* money_machine.py

Instructor wants me to complete the project by not looking at those files  
but use them as some third-party library. I will import those files to main.py  
and browse through the documentation provided by the instructor. The goal is to  
learn how to use other people code in your own work. Build the coffee machine  
from day 15 but this time with classes and objects.  

Try to learn more about classes and how different objects can be connected with  
methods. How CoffeeMaker.make_coffee() deducts ingridients from available  
resources depending on type of drink? I can create MenuItem() object and pass  
that object to CoffeeMaker(). How MenuItem() and Menu() works together, look  
at `__init__()` of both.  

Sounds confusing at first, when using other people code it is faster and easier  
to read the provided documentation than to read the source code. That is the  
main lesson of today. All i have to do is read the documentation, import the  
provided code to my project and make it work.  

Here are the requirements for the project
* Prompt user by asking: "What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino)"
* Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering "off" to the prompt.
* Print report.
* Check resources sufficient?
* Process coins.
* Check transaction successful?
* Make Coffee.
