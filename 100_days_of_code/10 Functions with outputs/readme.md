**day_10**
## Calculator  
Original program from the day_10 have loop feature so you can calculate
until user decide to quit. I wanted to keep the code clean with focus
on functions inside dictionary. Dictionary actually doesnt store functions,
instead it holds the names that you later pass to a variable.
Add parenthesis to that variable and you have function.
stored_name(param1, param2)
