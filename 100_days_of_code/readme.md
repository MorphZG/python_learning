Developer and lead instructor at the London App Brewery.  


#### about
Every day instructor starts a project. From simple, beginner level project at  
day one to more complex projects at day 100. After initial video lesson  
instructor begins to challange the student with different assignments ranging  
from simple to very complex. Video is paused and i am given instructions on  
what to do next.  

Solution to assignments is not obvious from start since i usually have to do  
some more research on topic to get it right. This is definitely not standard  
"hold my hand" tutorial you can find online. With every lesson instructor  
rises the level of challange to push
