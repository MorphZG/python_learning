### about
Every day instructor starts a project. From simple, beginner level project at
day one to more complex projects at day 100. After initial video lesson
instructor begins to challange the student with different assignments ranging
from simple to very complex. Video is paused and i am given instructions on
what to do next.

Solution to assignments is not obvious from start since i usually have to do
some more research on topic to get it right. This is definitely not standard
"hold my hand" tutorial you can find online. With every lesson instructor
rises the level of challange to push
