day_18

I already have experience with standard library and built in packages but i
also work with poetry and pip to create virtual environments. Instructor
uses PyCharm and installs the packages with a few mouse clicks.
I use command line very often so instead of PyCharm i did it with Poetry.

Main takeaway from this lesson was how to use official documentation and
various online resources to complete the project.

- Packages used: turtle, colorgram
- How to import third-party modules? How to read official documentation?
- Damien Hirst, sold art piece (Antipyrylazo III) for 1,2 million pounds, will
use turtle and colorgram to create similar graphics
