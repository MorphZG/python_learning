**day 24**
## Files, directories and paths

In introduction video instructor mentions previous project, Snake game. We can  
improve it by creating a file that will track the highest score. After learning  
about basic file manipulation, we will create a program that will automate  
mail merging and let python do the repetitive tasks.  

To be honest i did not participate in the first part when instructor asked to  
revisit the old Snake files and implement high score reading and writing to   
file. I just copied the code, watch the video tutorial and proceeded to the next  
assignment.  

Mail merging. After brief introduction to concept of reading and writing to  
files, instructor jumps to challange without much tutoring. I got two folders,  
Input, with list of Names and Letters to send and Output folder with single  
example.txt file that shows the final result.  

In main.py i have few short hints to point me in right direction. I should use  
online resources to learn more about readlines() replace() and strip() functions  
- Create a letter using starting_letter.txt for each name in invited_names.txt
- Replace the [name] placeholder with the actual name
- Save the letters in the folder "ReadyToSend"  

While doing the assignment i was worried to much about nesting. **How to indent**  
"with open" blocks and for loops. How to access different variables.... But  
than i realised that all variables belongs to **global space** and there is no need  
to overthink. I refactored my code and simplified it.  

I have intreset in regular expressions for a long time. That is also one  
of reasons why i use grep and tag these python files. Would be good practice  
build the same program using builtin "re" module for regular expressions.
