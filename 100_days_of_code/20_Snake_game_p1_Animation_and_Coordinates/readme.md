day 20

Building a Snake game!
This one makes me happy. Brings back the memories on my firs Nokia 3310.
Snake project will be split in 2 parts and across 2 "days", or should i better
say 2 folders.

In first part instructor presents the project and breaksdown the goals on smaller
parts. Create a snake body, move the snake and control the snake in first part.
Detect collison with food, create a scoreboard, detect collision with walls and
detect collision with tail in next part.

What surprised me is the use of turtle library. I will build the snake by
creating the square turtles. Starting snake will be made out of 3 square
turtles. That is my first challange is simple. Think about how to line them up
one behind the other in the center of the screen. Each turtle should be a white
square with default size of 20x20.
