Building a quiz app.
Split the app in 4 different files: main.py, data.py, question_model.py, quiz_brain.py

I learned class bascis from another material, book "Python crash course" which
is also in this repository. This lesson helped me to learn more about interaction
between different classes. How to create separate module for each class, import
them to single main.py file
