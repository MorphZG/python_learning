I have downloaded these files:
    coffee_maker.py
    menu.py
    money_machine.py

Instructor wants me to complete the project by not looking at those files
but use them as some external library. I will import those files to main.py and
browse through the documentation provided by the instructor. The goal is to
learn how to use other people code in your own work. Build the coffee machine
from day 15 but this time with classes and objects.

Try to learn more about classes and how different objects can be connected with
methods. How CoffeeMaker.make_coffee() deducts ingridients from available
resources depending on type of drink? I can create MenuItem() object and pass
that object to CoffeeMaker(). How MenuItem() and Menu() works together, look
at __init__() of both.
