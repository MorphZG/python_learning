**day_17**
## Building a quiz app  
Split the app in 4 different files: main.py, data.py, question_model.py, quiz_brain.py

I learned about class basics from another material, book "Python crash course"
which is also in this repository. This lesson helped me to learn more about
interaction between different classes. How to organize separate modules for
every class and than import them to main.py file. How classes can reference
each other instead of self.

day_17 got me helped me to better understand object oriented paradigm. I found
some e-books about the topic and hopefuly will read them soon.
