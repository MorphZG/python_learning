More Turtle graphics, event listeners, state and multiple instances.
Will make few mini games. Etch a Sketch kids game with turtle graphics and
small mini race with turtles. Program will listen the keyboard inputs.

sketch.py holds the simple code for drawing with keyboard. Simple code but i
learned about higher order functions and functions that can wait for events to
execute code

race.py increase the challange. my main assignent is to create 6 different
turtles and position them on the left side of screen one above the other.
instructor starts by defining the basics like screen.setup() and few basic
variables. i am trying to be creative and not repeat myself, like i do in
every exercise all the time.
