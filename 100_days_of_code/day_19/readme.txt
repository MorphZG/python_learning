More Turtle graphics, event listeners, state and multiple instances.
Will make few mini games. Etch a Sketch kids game with turtle graphics and
small mini race with turtles. Program will listen the keyboard inputs.

sketch.py holds the simple code for drawing with keyboard. Simple code but i
learned about higher order functions and functions that can wait for events to
execute code
