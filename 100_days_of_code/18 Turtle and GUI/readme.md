## Turtle and GUI
I already have experience with standard library and built in packages but i
also work with poetry and pip to create virtual environments. Instructor
uses PyCharm and installs the packages with a few mouse clicks.
I use command line very often so instead of PyCharm i did it with Poetry.

Main takeaway from this lesson was how to use official documentation and
various online resources to complete the project.

- Packages used: turtle, colorgram
- How to import third-party modules? How to read official documentation?
- Damien Hirst, sold art piece (Antipyrylazo III) for 1,2 million pounds.

After first few assignments completed in exercise.py use colorgram to extract
at least 10 colors from the image and store them as RGB tuples so turtle can
use it for painting. Main assignment is to draw 10 by 10 rows of dots with
every dot having size of 20 and spacing between them 50.
