## Instances and higher order functions
More Turtle graphics, event listeners, state and multiple instances.
Will make few mini games. Etch a Sketch kids game with turtle graphics and
small mini race with turtles. Program will listen the keyboard inputs.

sketch.py holds the simple code for drawing with keyboard. Simple code but i
learned about higher order functions and functions that can wait for events to
execute code

race.py increase the challange. My main assignent is to create 6 different
turtles and position them on the left side of screen one above the other.
Instructor starts by defining the basics like screen.setup() and few basic
variables. I am trying to be creative and not repeat myself.

Next task will be to make every turtle move random ammount of points and
declare the winner for first turtle to reach the finish.
