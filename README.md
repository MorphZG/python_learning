# Python, learning repository

This repository is my first experience with git and github so i will try  
to learn about git CLI commands and hopefuly contribute to some open source  
projects soon. I am also very organized and would like to keep my repositories  
well structured and documented. Editing these readme.md files will help me get  
better at markdown syntax so i am really enjoying the overall experience of  
learning and being useful  

Almost all files have tags at the bottom line so i can grep through them.  
That way i can search for important topics like all exercises where i use  
classes or some builtin functions. All tags are written as singular  
(class instead of classes or loop instead of loops)  

```bash
$ grep -rnB1 "#tags.*class"

-r recursive
-n show line number
-B1 show previous 1 line (this line holds the list of modules)
```

My favorite projects so far:

- Collection of many different projects: [100 days of code](https://github.com/MorphZG/python_projects/tree/main/100_days_of_code)

## Disclaimer

All these files and small projects are not designed by me. These are the  
exercises i completed. No cheating, no copy and paste. Everything you see  
here is everything i have learned through various resources. In some files  
you will see soultion by the author commented at the bottom.
