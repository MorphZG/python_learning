This repository is my first experience with git and github so i will try \
to learn about git CLI commands and hopefuly contribute to some open source
projects soon. I am also very organized and would like to keep my repositories
well structured and documented. Editing these readme.md files will help me get
better at markdown syntax so i am really enjoying the overall experience of 
learning and being useful

### Disclaimer!
All these files and small projects are not designed by me. These are the \
exercises i completed. No cheating, no copy and paste. Everything you see \
here is everything i have learned through various resources. In some files \
you will see soultion by the author commented at the bottom.

Almost all files have tags at the bottom line so i can grep through them.

```
$ grep -rnB1 "#tags.*function"

-r recursive
-n line number
-B1 show previous 1 line (this line holds the list of modules)
```

My favorite projects so far:
- [100 days of code](https://github.com/MorphZG/python_projects/tree/main/100_days_of_code)
