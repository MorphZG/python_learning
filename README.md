### Disclaimer!\
All these files and small projects are not designed by me. These are the \
exercises i completed. No cheating, no copy and paste. Everything you see \
here is everything i have learned through various resources. In some files \
you will see soultion by the author commented at the bottom.


This is just a simple readme file for my simple python projects repository. \
Every exercise and every tutorial i did is inside these folders. \
Almost all files have tags at the bottom line so i can grep through them.

```
$ grep -rnB1 "#tags.*function"

-r recursive
-n line number
-B1 show previous 1 line (this line holds the list of modules)
```

This repository is also my first experience with git and github so will try \
to learn about git CLI commands and contribute to some github projects.


My favorite projects so far:
- [100 days of code](https://github.com/MorphZG/python_projects/tree/main/100_days_of_code)
