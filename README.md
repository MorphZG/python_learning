This is just a simple readme file for my simple python projects repository. \
Every exercise and every tutorial i did is inside these folders. \
Almost all files have tags at the bottom line so i can grep through them.

$ grep -rnB1 "#tags.*function" \
-r recursive \
-n line number \
-B1 show previous 1 line (this line holds the list of modules)
